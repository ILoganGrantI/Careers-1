Be careful with indie studios though, if you don’t have the resources to fall back on; indie studios can be volatile, with some of them seeming to fold as soon as they’ve opened. […]Some of the fastest-growing studios in the world make only apps and casual games, and with more people than ever having access to mobile devices capable of playing these games, we’re seeing a sharp increase in the number of mobile sales. This means teams need to be bigger to keep up with demand, which means more jobs available.[…]. Freelance game designers can easily find work online, and the nature of that work ranges from checking game design documents for inconsistencies to helping lone designers flesh out their ideas. Consulting on games freelance is a career path in of itself, but is definitely something that can be done alongside a less taxing role, so it might be worth considering if you’re already working.</p>'
